=============

Play Apple HTTP Live Streaming format with Adobe Open Source Media Player

***NOTE: I am not maintining this repository!***  It represents modifications I made to Adobe's Open Source Media Framework and the [apple-http-osmf plugin](http://code.google.com/p/apple-http-osmf/) to add support for clip discontinuities.

You are welcome to take my modifications and use them if they are helpful to you, but they are provided AS-IS with no support or updates.  If you wish to take over this project and maintain it, by all means, please do fork it!
